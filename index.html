 <h2>Sometimes the World Is Weird</h2>
 <p>In part, taking things for granted is a sort of habituation. 
    When novelty wears off, our gratitude and awareness diminish, 
    and we shift our focus to the next minutely interesting idea. 
    It's scary how easy it is for one to just assume that 
    places, 
    people, 
    ideas, 
    and even memories will be eternal- 
    though we all know in the back of our heads, that nothing truly is. 
    It's a pity when one takes things for granted. 
    
    Because only after it's gone, does one realize how precious that commodity was.</p>
