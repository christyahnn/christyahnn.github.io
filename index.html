 <h2>isn't it?</h2>
 <p>In part, taking things for granted is a sort of habituation.<br> 
    When novelty wears off, our gratitude and awareness diminish,<br> 
    and we shift our focus to the next minutely interesting idea.<br> 
    It's scary how easy it is for one to just assume that<br> 
    places,<br> 
    people,<br> 
    ideas,<br> 
    and even memories will be eternal-<br> 
    though we all know in the back of our heads, that nothing truly is.<br> 
    It's a pity when one takes things for granted.<br> 
    <br>
    Because only after it's gone, does one realize how precious that commodity was.</p>
